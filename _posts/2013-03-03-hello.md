Some notes on the first day and a half:

* CSS is harder to understand than inline styles: I'm not sure if we should have taught inline styles first.
* A lot of this is just typing accuracy: getting the `{` and `}` in the right places. This disadvantages kids with less typing proficiency and makes it harder to teach topics.
* A few things that have been hard to explain: `span` and `div` elements. URLs. Proper names.

Sarah had the great idea of making 'review' exercises that reiterate combinations of the facts that we learn.

* Afternoons are hard for kids - they burn out quickly.
