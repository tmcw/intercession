## People

* [Grace Hopper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper)
* [Alan Turing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)
* [Alan Turing](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/alan-turings-body/282641/)
* [Ada Lovelace](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/10/ada-lovelace-the-first-tech-visionary.html)
* Tom Stoppard adapted Lovelace into a character in his play, "Acadia", but this play may still be too advanced for 9th/10th graders? 

## Projects

* [Theo Watson's Studio, Design-IO](http://design-io.com/)
* As recommended by Mary Rose Cook: Build using [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com), then make customizations. The benefit here is that students need only gain familiarity with code - get a feel for fluency rather than have to build it from the bottom up. All students, irregardless of skill level, would leave the class with a professional looking project.
* As recommended by Kuri DiFede (Tech at Dalton): [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org)

## Books

We need books that fit into a 1-week period and cover history and future of computing in an
engaging way.

Perhaps it would be best to use exercepts and articles rather than buying a single book. For example, one day we can read a moving part of Hackers, and talk about how it is also problematic, and then move onto something new the next.

### Potential

* [CODE](http://www.charlespetzold.com/code/) - somewhat similar to `The Information` in purpose, this is a low-level first introduction to symbol languages, binary, and so on. Focused on getting people to a familiar level with technology, it's accessible and at an accessible reading level. Little narrative or people.
* [10 PRINT](http://10print.org/) - about creative coding & art - written mostly in the language of art with the lingo of tech. Great for coders interested in this field and artists interested in code willing to Wikipedia the topics.
* [Hackers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution) - about hacker culture. Starts off in MIT, replays the hacker-as-emaciated-young-white-male stereotype which was true back then. When it gets out of historical time, talks a lot about hacker mentality as a creative & experimental force.

### No

* [The Information](http://www.amazon.com/The-Information-History-Theory-Flood/dp/1400096235)
  was an early pick but it's a little too long and dry for this type of class.
